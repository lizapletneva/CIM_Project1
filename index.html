        <p class="learn-more" style="display:none;">Pierre de Coubertin was a French educator and historian best known for founding the 
            modern Olympic Games. Born on January 1, 1863, in Paris, he believed in the importance of physical education and sports in 
            promoting moral and social values. Coubertin was inspired by his visit to the ancient Olympic sites in Greece and the ideals 
            of the classical games, leading him to advocate for the revival of the Olympics. In 1896, he organized the first modern Olympic
             Games, establishing the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and promoting the Olympic motto, “Citius, Altius, Fortius” 
             (Faster, Higher, Stronger). His vision was not just to create a sporting event but to foster international understanding and 
             peace through athletics. Coubertin's dedication to the Olympic movement laid the groundwork for the Games as we know them today, 
             emphasizing competition, camaraderie, and the spirit of sportsmanship. He continued to influence the Olympics until his death in 
             1937, leaving a lasting legacy that endures in the modern world of sports.</p> <!-- Learn More Text -->

        <p class="learn-more" style="display:none;">The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, from April 6 to April 15, 1896. 
            Organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), founded by Pierre de Coubertin, the event marked a revival of the ancient Olympic 
            Games that took place in Olympia from 776 BC to 393 AD. About 280 athletes from 13 countries participated, including Greece, the 
            United States, Germany, France, and Britain, with all competitors being male. The games featured 43 events across nine sports, such as 
            athletics, swimming, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, weightlifting, wrestling, tennis, and shooting. The Panathenaic Stadium, renovated 
            for the games, served as the main venue and could accommodate approximately 80,000 spectators. Winners received silver medals and olive 
            branches, while second place earned bronze; gold medals were not introduced until the 1904 Games. The 1896 Olympics symbolized a return 
            to the values of physical fitness, competition, and international camaraderie, setting the foundation for the modern Olympic movement 
            and inspiring subsequent Olympiads.</p> <!-- Learn More Text -->

        <p class="learn-more" style="display:none;">The Olympic Games have faced cancellations due to various circumstances 
            throughout history. The most notable cancellations occurred during World War I and World War II. The 1916 Summer 
            Olympics, scheduled to be held in Berlin, were canceled because of the ongoing conflict of World War I. Similarly, 
            the 1940 Summer Olympics, initially planned for Tokyo, were first moved to Helsinki due to the war's outbreak, and 
            ultimately canceled. The 1944 Summer Olympics, set to take place in London, were also called off due to the continued 
            effects of World War II. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics faced a historic postponement, becoming the first Games to be delayed 
            in peacetime, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, eventually taking place in 2021 instead. Each of these cancellations 
            reflects the impact of global events on the Olympic movement and the challenges faced in maintaining the Games' continuity.
            There were no Olympic Games held in 1999 as that is not an Olympic year. </p> <!-- Learn More Text -->
